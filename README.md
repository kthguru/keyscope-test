### The Open Source Redis & Valkey GUI Client

**Keyscope** is a high-performance GUI client designed for **Redis** and **Valkey**.
It supports Cluster, Sentinel, SSH tunneling, and handles millions of keys smoothly.

Built with ❤️ using [valkey_client](https://pub.dev/packages/valkey_client) and [dense_table](https://pub.dev/packages/dense_table).

---

> **Why Keyscope?**  
> While existing tools are heavy (Electron-based) or lack support for modern Valkey features, Keyscope runs natively on **Flutter**, powered by the high-performance [valkey_client](https://pub.dev/packages/valkey_client) and [dense_table](https://pub.dev/packages/dense_table).

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Secure:** Built-in SSH Tunneling and TLS (SSL) support.
* **Multi-Platform:** Runs natively on macOS, Windows, and Linux.
* **Developer Friendly:** JSON viewer, CLI console, and dark mode optimized for engineers.
